# Chicago Crime Data

The purpose of this application is to quantitatively display crime trends for Chicago.
All data used is from the City of Chicagoâ€™s data portal which is updated every seven days.
Data is filtered by years and crime type - with theft, battery, narcotics, assault and burglary being the most commonly committed.
Most of the data compares the previous five years, however we gathered crime statistics dating back to 2001.

Another purpose of this application is to change the perspective one has about crime in Chicago. 
Users can input their address or a Chicago zip-code to see a list of offenses that occured in the given area. 
A map marked with pins dropped on the locations of these crimes is displayed alongside these crimes

We also encourage users to share and discuss their thoughts on or what they have learned from the data.
